    WARNINGï¼šRestrictions of Barrier APIs.
    
    1. Barrier APIs can be used only in MIX kernels. The compiler will optimize the kernel to VEC or CUBE if it lacks effective cube instructions (eg. Mmad) or vector instructions (eg: DataCopy). 
    Need compiler updates to remove this feature, or insert Mmad/DataCopy calls manully.

    2. Barrier APIs conflict with SyncAll. Avoid mixing them together.
    
    3. We provide 2 kinds of barrier:
        a. shmem_barrier_xxx
            Barrier of all cores. On systems with only HCCS: All operations of all ranks of a team on excuting stream before the barrier are visiable to all ranks of the team after the barrier.
        b. shmemx_barrier_xxx_vec
            Barrier of all VEC cores. On systems with only HCCS: All operations of ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of a team on excuting stream before the barrier are visiable to ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of the team after the barrier.
        
        This subtle difference is beneficial to compute-communiction overlapping (usually UNI_DIRECTIONAL dependency), and could achieve better performance. Refer to examples/matmul_allreduce for details.

    4. The scalar unit of cube core is not affected by shmem_barrier_xxx. Make sure don't use that.
