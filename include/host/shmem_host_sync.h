    Unlike semantic of legacy barrier:
        All operations of all ranks of a team before the barrier are visiable to all ranks of the team after the barrier.
    Our implementation ensures that:
        All operations of ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of a team ON EXECUTING/INTERNAL STREAMs before the barrier are visiable to ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of the team after the barrier.
        
    Refer to shmem_device_sync.h for other constraints.
