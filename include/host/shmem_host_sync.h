    WARNINGï¼š 
    
    1. Barriers can be used only in MIX kernels. The compiler will optimize the kernel to VEC or CUBE if it lacks effective cube instructions (eg. Mmad) or vector instructions (eg: DataCopy). 
    Need compiler updates to remove this feature, or insert Mmad/DataCopy calls manully.
    
    2. Unlike semantic of legacy barrier:
            All operations of all ranks of a team before the barrier are visiable to all ranks of the team after the barrier.
        Our implementation ensures that:
            All operations of ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of a team before the barrier are visiable to ALL VEC CORES of all ranks of the team after the barrier.
        
        Refer to shmem_device_sync.h for more details.
